To whom it may concern,
The story of Aven Zemo begins in the rain city of Seattle. 
Far more complex than meets the eye. A man of few words, Zemo found silence added power to every statement. 
The fortunate are born with two ears and one mouth but social media has promoted an enviorment of all speak and hear loss.
Compassion and empathy are the sure cure of it all but at what cost shall allow this to progrogate here with us all?
